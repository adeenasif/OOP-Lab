## Repository Overview

This repository contains my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Lab assignments as part of my coursework. It includes practical implementations of OOP concepts in C++ through various coding questions.

## Lab 1
| File	| Description |
|-------|------------|
| Q1.cpp |	Finds the second highest number in a float type array. Array length and data are taken as parameters in the main function. |
| Q2.cpp |	Calculates sum of all elements in an array. Array length and data are taken as parameters in the main function. |
| Q3.cpp |	To calculate bill acc to the question requirements. %.2f was used to fix 2 decimal places. |
| Q4.cpp |	Convert weight from kgs to pounds. |
| Q5.cpp |	Basic calculations on given data. |
| Q6.cpp |	Finds average test scores. Array length and data are taken as parameters in the main function. |

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/adeenasif/OOP-Lab/tree/main/Lab%201`
   
3. Navigate to the repository folder:  
   `cd OOP-Lab-1`  

4. Compile any C++ file using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++):  
   `g++ Q1.cpp -o Q1`  

5. Run the compiled executable:  
   `./Q1`  

## Prerequisites
C++ Compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
Basic understanding of C++ programming
