## Repository Overview

This repository contains my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Lab assignments as part of my coursework. It includes practical implementations of OOP concepts in C++ through various coding questions.

## Lab 1
| File	| Description |
|-------|------------|
| Q1.cpp |	Finds the second highest number in a float type array. Array length and data are taken as parameters in the main function. |
| Q2.cpp |	Calculates sum of all elements in an array. Array length and data are taken as parameters in the main function. |
| Q3.cpp |	To calculate bill acc to the question requirements. %.2f was used to fix 2 decimal places. |
| Q4.cpp |	Convert weight from kgs to pounds. |
| Q5.cpp |	Basic calculations on given data. |
| Q6.cpp |	Finds average test scores. Array length and data are taken as parameters in the main function. |

## How to Run
